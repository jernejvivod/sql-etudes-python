# sql-etudes-python
This is a python project developed to solve the tasks for the 1. homework for the Big Data class (2021/2022).

## Instructions for Running

run `pip -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements.

run `python3 main.py` in the package root folder to obtain and visualize the results. The results are stored in the [./sql_etudes_python/data_analysis/results](sql_etudes_python/data_analysis/results) folder.

# TODO

This project needs some refactoring. The package should be concerned only with producing the results and should be called from the root project folder. Also, the results should be stored outside the package to a user-specified path.
